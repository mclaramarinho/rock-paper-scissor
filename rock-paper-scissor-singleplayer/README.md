## THE CHALLENGE
- To develop a single-player rock-paper-scissor game, from scratch

## WHAT WAS EXPECTED AS A RESULT
- The player should be able to choose a movement (rock/paper/scissor)
- The player decides when the choice is made (hit the play button)
- When the play button is clicked, the computer will play
- The computer chooses the movement randomly
- A reset button to refresh the page
